      <h1>  Plotting territorial income distribution and other demographic indicators in the city of Barcelona</h1>
      <p> The objective of this article is to analyze and plot choropleth maps of territorial income distribution 
        and other demographic indicators in the city of Barcelona obtained from <a href="https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en/" style="color: blue">Barcelona open data repository</a> using Python's 
        <a href="http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/" style="color: blue" >Folium</a> library. 
        Here we only present the final results, detailed technical implementation explaination is available in my  
        <a href= BCN_choropleth_maps.html style="color: blue"> Jupyter Notebook</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>  Income distribution in the city of Barcelona</h2>
      <p> The first dataset that we are going to analyze is the 
        <a href="https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/est-renda-familiar" style="color: blue"> Renta Familiar Disponible (RFD) index dataset</a>,
        this dataset contains the Disposable Family Income Index by Neighborhood, the most recent one is from year 2017, therefore as presented in the following table. 

        The RFD index of Barcelona city is 100, therefore neighborhoods with RFD index lower than 100 represent that 
        their RFD index are below average of the city and the same logic goes with neighborhoods with RFD index higher or equall than 100. 
        Today, Barcelona contains 73 different neighborhoods, to better illustrate the RFD index by neighborhoods, we plot this data onto a choropleth map. 
        A choropleth map is a type of statistical thematic map that uses pseudocolor, i.e., color corresponding with an aggregate summary of a geographic 
        characteristic within spatial enumeration units, such as population density or per-capita income.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we present two different choropleth map, the one on the left have neighborhoods colored from yellow to red according to their RFD index, as illustrated by the colorscale on top of the map.  
        Choropleth map on the right uses two different colorscale to better differentiate neighborhoods with lower 
        than average RFD index with neighborhoods with equall or higher than average RFD index.

        src= "choropleth maps/bcn_renta_2017_2.html"> </iframe>
      </p>
      <p> As we can observe, most of the neighborhoods in the north east or south part of the city seem to 
        have RFD index lower than average and the highest RFD index neighborhoods are located in the north east
        part of the city. 49 neighborhoods have below average RFD index and 24 neighborhoods have equal or higher RFD index than average.
        The 3 highest RFD index neighborhoods are Pedralbes, les Tres Torres, and Sarrià, 
        with RFD index of 248.8, 215.8, and 193.6 respectively. The 3 lowest RFD index neighborhoods are 
        Ciutat Meridiana, la Marina del Prat Vermell, and Vallbona, with RFD index of 38.6, 40.0, and 40.9 respectively. 
        These maps indicate that there is a substantial income inequality among the neighborhoods, we can check if this 
        inequality has been increasing or decreasing over the past years by comparing with RFD index of the neighborhoods from prvious years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The oldest dataset available in the repository is from year <a href= "https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/est-renda-familiar/resource/935b8e2f-996f-4829-8586-c7ddfcb9ba18" 
        style="color: blue">2007</a>, therefore we compare the RFD index of year 2007 with year 2017 to calculate
        the percentage changes of RFD index over the past 10 years. Choropleth map on the left below illustrates the RFD index with 2 different colorscales, 
        choropleth map on the right illustrates the RFD percentage change over the last decade, negative and positive changes are also differentiated by 2
        different colorscale. 
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>   
        The income distribution in 2007 is very similar to 2017. 50 neighborhoods 
        have below average RFD index and 23 neighborhoods have equal or higher RFD index than average.
        The 3 highest RFD index neighborhoods are les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and Sant Gervasi - Galvany,
        with RFD index of 215.3, 193.6, and 187.0 respectively. The 3 lowest RFD index neighborhoods are 
        Baró de Viver, Can Peguera, and Vallbona, with RFD index of 44.5, 49.8, and 51.6 respectively. 
        Some of the poorer neighborhoods had a positive RFD change such as Baró de Viver with a positive 
        RFD change of 54.83%, and some of the richer neighborhoods had some minor negative RFD change such as
        Vallvidrera, el Tibidabo i les Planes, with a RFD change of -1.57%. However, overall, the inequality 
        among different neighborhoods has clearly increased over the last decade. Most neighborhoods in the 
        north east part of the city have experienced a decrease in RFD index. In 2017, most of the
        poorer neighborhoods are even relatively poorer than 10 decades ago.
